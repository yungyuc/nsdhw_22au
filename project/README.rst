NSD Term Project
================

This is the directory for the term project proposal.  To turn it in, you need
**a PR** and **an E3 entry for the PR URL**.  See
https://yyc.solvcon.net/en/latest/nsd/schedule/22au_nycu/schedule.html for what
should be included in the proposal and project.

The proposal accounts for 8 points out of the 40 points allocated to the term
project.  Like homework, you will need to create a PR against the ``project``
branch (not ``master``).  You need to create a sub-directory using exactly your
GitHub username as your working directory (``nsdhw_22au/project/$username/``).
The hierarchy should be like::

  - nsdhw_22au (<- repository root)
    - project
      - username (<- your working directory)
        - README.rst (<- the main proposal file)
        - ... other files for your proposal

**ATTENTION**: Your PR should include an entry in "Porject List by Account
Name" in this file.

When submitting your proposal, name the PR as ``<username>-proposal**``, e.g.,
``yungyuc-proposal-submission``.  Don't forget to put the PR URL in the E3
entry too.  You can request my review in the PR.

.. Presentation
.. ============

.. The presentation schedule is set.  If you want to change time slots, ask for
   the owner of the other time slot and file a PR tagging him or her and the
   instructor (@yungyuc) against the branch `master`. The other owner needs to
   respond to agree the exchange in the PR. The PR subject line should start
   with ``[presentation]``.

.. Each presentation can use at most 15 minutes.  Presenters may decide how to
   use their time.  A possible arrangement is to use 12 minutes in the
   presentation itself and 3 minutes for questions and discussions.  Presenters
   are expected to prepare their own computer for presentation.

.. The time for setting up the computer is included in the allotted
   presentation time.  If presenters have difficulty in preparing a computer
   themselves, they may seek help from the instructor, and resolve the issue
   one week before their presentation.
