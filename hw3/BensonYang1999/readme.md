# Homework description

This version is running on WSL on Windows 11, so the running time may vary due to the loading of other application.

In `performance.txt`, I printout the following information: 
 - running time of different multiplication method (naive, tile, MKL) and the ratio between them
 - running time of different block size
 - check the answer correctness of different method

Just running `make statistic`, it will generate this text file by running `statistic.cpp`.

I also test on ARM architecture CPU, detailed in `arm` folder.
